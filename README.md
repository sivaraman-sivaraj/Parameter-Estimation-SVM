Folders:

Code -                    codes for finding SVM regression co-effiencet, output results of surge,sway,yaw are saved in .npy format./ 
Hydrodynamics _ derivatives -    codes for real hydrodynamic derivatives are derived from raw regrssion co-efficients. 
                               (raw regression co_eff files should copied from Code folder to here to run this codes.)/

Files:

pre-processing - codes for getting different number of samples/
SD_calculation - codes for calculating standard deviation of different number of  samples/
trail          - bin/
